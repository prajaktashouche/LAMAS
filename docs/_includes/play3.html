            This play starts differently from the other two. Alice is given an A&spades; and a <span class="hearts">3&hearts;</span>,
            Bob is given a 2&spades; and a <span class="hearts">A&hearts;</span>. Charlie is given a 3&spades; and a
            <span class="hearts">2&hearts;</span>.

            First, Alice places down her A&spades; and truthfully announces her action<img

            Neither Bob nor Charlie can
            doubt, as neither of them have both Aces, so they accept. But now Bob knows that Charlie has at least one
            non-Ace card, and viceversa.

        <div id="p3-turn-2" class="play">
            Next, Bob must place a 2. He places down his 2&spades;, and truthfully announces it <img

            Neither Alice nor Bob can doubt, as neither has both
            2s in their hand.

            Now it is Charlie's turn. He places downHe places down his 3&spades; <img

            Neither Alice nor Bob can doubt, as
            neither has both 3s in their hand.

            Alice must now place down an Ace. But she doesn't have any, and places down her 3&spades;, falsely

            only Ace in
            his hand. He doubts Alice's move, and thus she loses.
