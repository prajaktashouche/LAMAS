    <p class="state-p">Description:</p>

    <section>
        <div id="p1-turn-0" class="play">
            First, the cards are dealt. Alice is given an A&spades; and a <span class="hearts">3&hearts;</span>, Bob is given a 2&spades; and a 3&spades;. Charlie is given a <span class="hearts">A&hearts;</span> and a <span class="hearts">2&hearts;</span>.
        </div>

        <div id="p1-turn-1" class="play">
            Alice places down Ace (A&spades;) and truthfully announces she has put down an Ace. Bob could doubt, however neither of his cards are Aces, so he believes it would be logical not to. Charlie could also doubt, since he has one Ace (<span class="hearts">A&hearts;</span>), however he does not know whether it is Alice or Bob who has the other Ace, so he waits. As neither has doubted, Bob can now infer that Charlie does not have 2 Aces, and Charlie can infer that Bob does not have 2 aces.
        </div>

        <div id="p1-turn-2" class="play">
            Bob places down 2 (2&spades;) and truthfully announces he has put down a 2. Alice chooses not to doubt, as
            she does not own any 2s. Charlie does not doubt either, as he does not have both 2s. But now, again, as
            neither of them has doubted, Alice and Charlie both know that the other does not have both 2s.
        </div>

        <div id="p1-turn-3" class="play">
            Charlie must now place down a 3. However, he does not have any, and so he places down a 2 (<span class="hearts">2&hearts;</span>) from his hand and lies that he has put down a 3. Since both Alice and
            Bob each has a 3 in their hand, neither can call a bluff as there is a possible world where Charlie can have a 3 in his hand. However, this is a manipulative update and both infer now that the other doesn't have a 3 in their hand.
        </div>

        <div id="p1-turn-4" class="play">
            Alice must once again place down an Ace. Since she doesn't have any, she passes this turn. This in turn lets the other players infer the same and updates the possible worlds where Alice can have another Ace in her hand.

        </div>

        <div id="p1-turn-5" class="play">
            Now it is Bob's turn to place an Ace. But he too doesn't have an Ace and chooses to pass the turn. Hence,
            other player knowledge as well as the possible worlds are updated.
        </div>

        <div id="p1-turn-6" class="play">
            <p>It is Charlie's turn to place the elusive Ace. Since he lied before and is still in play, he has his
                remaining card which is an Ace and he chooses to truthfully announce he has placed an Ace. As neither of the other player's have an Ace in their hand, they accept the move and do not doubt.</p>

            <p>This can be seen in the final state of the graph where the relation from real world to other worlds for
                Alice and Bob displays Charlie having an Ace in his hand.</p>

            <p>For Example: Bob has access to <span class="root-node">w21</span> from <span class="real-node">w0</span>, we can see in <span class="root-node">w21</span> Charlie does have an Ace.</p>

            <p>And so Charlie wins.</p>
