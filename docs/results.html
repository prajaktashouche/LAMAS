<h1>Results</h1>

<div>
    We ran a simulated play of 500 runs to obtain a quantitative analysis. The strategy we went with is to use random
    choice of either passing the turn, or placing a random card, if the player does not have the expected card in their
    hand. Otherwise, the player will always truthfully place the card if they have it in their hand. The runs were done
    on two different types of deals, as given below.
</div>

<h2>Deal - 1</h2>

<div id="deal-1">
    <p>
        For deal one we have the below:
    </p>
    <div class="playingCards fourColours simpleCards rotateHand">
        {% include deals/deal1_h.html %}
    </div>

    <p>
        The results of running the simulation for 500 runs are given in the below table. We can see Alice has a high
        chance of winning with this deal, as she has 361 wins from the different strategies that were played on each
        turn.
        From the wins, she was able to get away with lying 36% of the time, while she has a higher winning rate by
        playing an honest game.
    </p>
    <p>
        Bob and Charlie also have a chance at winning if they employ the strategy of lying, as in all the games they
        won, they were able to get away with bluffing.
    </p>

        <div class="divTableBody">
            {% for item in site.data.stat1 %}
            <div class="divTableRow">
                <div class="divTableCell">{{ item.player }}</div>
                <div class="divTableCell">{{ item.won }}</div>

            </div>
            {% endfor %}
        </div>

    </div>
</div>

<h2>Deal - 2</h2>

<div id="deal-2">
    <p>
        For deal two we have the below:
    </p>
    <div class="playingCards fourColours simpleCards rotateHand">
        {% include deals/deal2_h.html %}
    </div>

    <p>
        The results of running the simulation for 500 runs are given in the below table. In this case, we can see that
        Alice was not able to win any games, as the strategy she used was to bluff, and each time the bluff was called
        out in different iterations of the play. While Bob is able to win 243 rounds of the game by employing the path
        of honesty. Charlie was not able to use any strategy to win the game.

<h1>Discussion</h1>

<p>We were able to see that in certain situations it is beneficial to the player to lie to win the game but it depends
    on the deal. For example: Alice has a higher chance of winning for deal-1 while 100% of losing in deal-2. It does
    not matter if she employs the strategy of lying or honesty in the latter case.</p>


<p>We have also seen that passing a turn can update the possible worlds to a situation where such a model cannot exist
    in reality. This can happen in manipulative updates as the player believes a dishonest statement to be true and thus
    there is a contradiction of the possible worlds with the real world.</p>

<p>We were also able to notice that bluffs are not called by the other players when the player has announced a statement
    truthfully, as no bluff is called unless the model is completely valid (and it is always the case that after a
    truthful announcement the model is valid).</p>

<h1>Future Work</h1>

<ul>
    <li>Increase the number of cards dealt to the players. This will increase the complexity and hence also the winning
        rate from a strategy of lying.
    </li>

    <li>Increase the number of cards that can be placed at a turn. Even if the number of cards in hand are increased, we
        can always get the same results if the players are only placing one card at each turn. So increasing the number
        of cards to place will also provide more opportunities to get away with bluffing.
    </li>

    <li>Increase the number of players.</li>
    <li>
        Allow players to call bluffs manipulatively. As players only call bluffs when they are completely sure of them,
        and they all know this fact, calling a bluff actually informs other players about the caller's own state.
    </li>
</ul>
