# Theory
The game was built using the model of manipulative lying proposed by Wang et al. (2011), which is based on the logic of communication and change by Benthem et al. (2005).Communication between agents implies changes in the world and the knowledge of agents. The communication takes place as actions in an epistemic model, hence influencing knowledge and belief of the agents. The actions in our game are public annoucements made by the players.
