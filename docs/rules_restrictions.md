#Restrictions
We will use a smaller version of the game to simplify the game mechanics as follows:
* players in the game can be between 2-10 but we will only consider 3 players in this project
* original deck size of 52 cards will be reduced to 6 cards where the value is from Ace, 2, and 3 with 2 cards each of suit heart and spades. This way each player gets 2 cards each.
