# Implementation

Our idea of implementation would build the Kripke model for the described setup. 
Based on the announcements made by each player, the knowledge of the other players will be updated and hence the model. Manipulative announcements can also happen (lies) which are public announcements of untrue propositions, whose announcer knows they are untrue and wishes them to be taken as truth. We intend to use a model of manipulative lying proposed by \citet{wang}, which is based on a logic of communication and change presented by \citet{benthem}. 

We will also consider a pre-built play of the game which can be explored step by step that shows how lying can be used in optimal strategies to take to win the game.


## Kripke Model
The Kripke model is build for our compact game setup with 3 players. 
### Common Knowledge
### States 
### Knowledge of each player
