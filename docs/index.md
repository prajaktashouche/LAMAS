# Project Description
Analyzing the card game *I Doubt It* from the perspective of player's own knowledge, common knowledge, belief and Public Announcement Logic. Each announcement by a player will change the current knowledge.

It is a game where the ability to deceive other players at the same time detect other players' deception comes into play. Decision needs to be made based on previous knowledge (assuming perfect memory of each round) as well as the last player's announcement to call out a bluff or not. These points make it a good candidate for the LAMAS project.
